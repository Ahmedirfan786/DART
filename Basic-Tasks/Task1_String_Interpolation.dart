// The main() function is the entry point of the program. It's where the execution of the program starts.

// Four variables are defined: firstname, lastname, age, and gender. These variables store information about a person's name, age, and gender.

// The values assigned to these variables are: "Ahmed" for firstname, "Irfan" for lastname, 20 for age, and "Male" for gender.

// The print() function is used to output messages to the console. In the first print() statement, a message is printed that includes the full name and age interpolated using the variables firstname, lastname, and age.

// In the second print() statement, a message is printed that includes the gender interpolated using the variable gender.

// \n in the second print() statement adds a new line for better formatting.
