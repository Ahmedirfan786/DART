Dart
An approachable, portable, and productive language for high-quality apps on any platform
<br>
Dart is:

Approachable: Develop with a strongly typed programming language that is consistent, concise, and offers modern language features like null safety and patterns.

Portable: Compile to ARM, x64, or RISC-V machine code for mobile, desktop, and backend. Compile to JavaScript or WebAssembly for the web.

Productive: Make changes iteratively: use hot reload to see the result instantly in your running app. Diagnose app issues using DevTools.

Dart's flexible compiler technology lets you run Dart code in different ways, depending on your target platform and goals:

Dart Native: For programs targeting devices (mobile, desktop, server, and more), Dart Native includes both a Dart VM with JIT (just-in-time) compilation and an AOT (ahead-of-time) compiler for producing machine code.

DartW: For programs targeting the web, Dart Web includes both a development time compiler (dartdevc) and a production time compiler (dart2js).
