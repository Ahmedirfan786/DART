// Starting Dart

void main(){
  print("Hello World!");
}

// Code Explanation
// 1) Main Function Start: The void main() function marks the beginning of the program's execution. It's where the program starts running its instructions.
// 2) Main Function Requirement: In Dart, every program must have a main function as its entry point. It's the first function the program calls when it begins execution.
// 3) Block of Code: The curly braces {} enclose a block of code. In Dart, they denote the start and end of such blocks, grouping together related instructions.
// 4) Printing Output: The print("Hello World!"); statement displays the text "Hello World!" on the screen or console. It's a way to communicate information to the user or developer.
// 5) Statement End: Each line of code in Dart typically concludes with a semicolon (;). This signals the end of a statement, indicating to the Dart compiler where one instruction ends and another begins.
// Additional Note: In Dart, you can also start the code without the void keyword, like main() { }. The void keyword indicates that the main function doesn't return a value. In Dart, it's a convention to use void for functions that don't return anything, although it's optional. If you omit void, Dart implicitly considers the function as returning void.
