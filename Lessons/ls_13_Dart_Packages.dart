// Lesson 13: Packages in Dart

// Dart packages are essential collections of code that extend the capabilities of Dart applications.
// They are managed via the Pub package manager and can be accessed from the pub.dev repository.

// Importance of Packages:
// 1. Code Reusability: Packages enable developers to reuse pre-written functionalities across projects.
// 2. Modularity: They promote modular development, breaking applications into manageable components.
// 3. Efficiency: Using packages saves development time by leveraging existing solutions.
// 4. Community Contribution: Developers can contribute packages and benefit from those contributed by others.

// Types of Packages:
// 1. System Packages: Built-in packages provided by the Dart SDK, offering fundamental functionalities.
// 2. External Packages: Third-party packages developed by the Dart community, catering to various needs.

// Dart I/O Package:
// Provides classes and utilities for handling input/output operations, including file and directory manipulation.

// Dart HTTP Package:
// Enables Dart applications to make HTTP requests and handle responses, facilitating communication with web servers and APIs.

// Dart Async Package:
// Provides utilities for asynchronous programming, including Futures, Streams, and async/await syntax, simplifying non-blocking operations.
